# DONARLINK
My website, DonarLink, goes beyond just detecting blood groups using fingerprint recognition. It also actively promotes blood donation. If a personâ€™s life is saved through the platform, it becomes mandatory for a family member of the recipient to donate blood. This ensures a continuous cycle of donation, making the system both effective and impactful.
